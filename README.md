This is going to be my second run through this project. I'm feeling extremely confident this time around and I have no idea how I let myself get so thrown off the first time. I'll revisit this section at the end though.

Everything went really well. I got this done much quicker than last time and had a lot less problems with using CSS. I honestly think what did me in the most the first time around was simply not being as focused as I should have been and missing too many days between study.
